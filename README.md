# Palooza Arcade

Palooza Arcade is a mobile app that brings multiplayer gaming to a whole new level.
This app requires users to be physically present in the same room for in-person social gatherings. By placing their mobile devices next to each other as instructed, players unlock the full potential of a game. Each screen displays a portion of the map, and as devices merge, a complete game map emerges, granting players a comprehensive view and enabling them to engage in one gameplay.
Palooza Arcade is designed for 2-4 players and offers players to select a game from the variety of games in the game library.
